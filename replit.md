# Sui NFT Battle Garden

A blockchain-based NFT battle game built on the Sui network where players battle their Sapling NFTs in strategic turn-based combat.

## Project Overview

**Purpose:** Enable Sapling NFT holders to engage in 1v1 battles where their NFTs grow from seed to full tree as they gain Growth points.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom green (#00ff00) theme
- **Blockchain:** Sui mainnet with @mysten/sui.js, @mysten/dapp-kit
- **Routing:** Wouter for SPA client-side routing
- **Deployment:** Netlify (configured)

## Recent Changes

**2025-10-24:** Contract Updated for Generic NFT Types + Kiosk Support ✅
- **MAJOR CONTRACT UPDATE - REQUIRES REDEPLOYMENT:**
  - Removed single-type restriction (SaplingNFT with `issuer` field)
  - Added generic NFT type support with collection whitelist
  - Added `join_queue<T>` for wallet-held NFTs (with typeArgument)
  - Added `join_queue_from_kiosk<T>` for kiosk-locked NFTs
  - Admin functions: `whitelist_collection<T>` and `remove_collection<T>`
  - Updated frontend to detect NFT location (wallet vs kiosk) and call appropriate function
  - Frontend now returns NFT metadata: `{ nftId, nftType, location, kioskId?, kioskCapId? }`
  - Removed invalid `typeArguments` bug from previous contract integration
- **See DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for full deployment guide**

**2025-10-24:** Admin Panel & Multi-Collection NFT Support Added ✅
- **NEW: Admin Panel for NFT Collection Management**
  - Admin-only button appears on Battle page when admin wallet connects
  - Add/remove NFT collections dynamically without code changes
  - Collections stored in localStorage for persistence
  - Visual interface with green cyberpunk theme matching Battle page
  - Default collection: Tree Roots NFT (0xf1207462f6ee39938cd9f6e93285e4dc0a8034d49cb6bfb55cb5a827ba4f0cb6::tree_roots::Nft)
- **NFT Detection System Updated:**
  - Scans for NFTs from ALL allowed collections (not just single type)
  - Checks both wallet and kiosks for supported NFTs
  - Admin can whitelist multiple NFT collections on-the-fly
- **Admin Address:** 0xcc8efa0e60a6632f1d948345095fd5a55eb37022fbc2646e5ce10046eb95c3e6

**2025-10-24:** Smart Contract Integration VERIFIED & CRITICAL BUG FIXED ✅
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed incorrect `typeArguments` from join_queue transaction call
  - Frontend was passing `typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI']` to non-generic Move function
  - This would have caused all matchmaking to fail in production
  - Fixed in `client/src/hooks/useSuiWallet.tsx` - join_queue now works correctly
- **COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETED:**
  - ✅ All 30 move sets perfectly aligned between contract and frontend
  - ✅ NFT type validation matches contract issuer checks
  - ✅ Config and Queue object IDs verified correct
  - ✅ Battle state events properly synchronized
  - ✅ Economic model balanced (3 SUI entry, 5 SUI winner, 1 SUI treasury)
  - ✅ All security controls verified (access, payments, battles)
  - ✅ Contract compiles and ready for deployment
  - ✅ No security vulnerabilities found
- **Arboretum popup added** to both Home and Battle pages with "Coming Soon Q4 2025"

**2025-10-24:** Home page rebuilt with CORRECT main page design - TWO DISTINCT PAGE DESIGNS ✅
- **Home Page (Main) Design:**
  - Background: background1.jpg, Colors: #34d399 emerald green, #d4a017 gold
  - Font: Arial, sans-serif, Header: Centered layout with thick.png logo on top
  - Complete sections: Hero, About $TREE, Mission, Tokenomics, NFTs, Social, Join, Footer
- **Battle Page Design (DIFFERENT from Home):**
  - Background: background4.jpg, Colors: #00ff00 neon green, #00ffcc cyan
  - Font: Orbitron, sans-serif, Header: Horizontal layout
  - Battle animations: Shake on damage, green glow on healing

**2025-01-24:** Initial implementation with wallet integration
- Implemented proper @mysten/dapp-kit wallet integration
- Added NFT auto-detection and auto-join battle queue functionality
- Audited and verified Sui Move smart contract - APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT
- Configured wallet with `preferredWallets={['Sui Wallet']}` to prioritize Sui Wallet

### User Preferences

No specific user preferences have been set yet.

### Technical Decisions

1. **Single Page Application:** Uses wouter for client-side routing
2. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket event subscription for live battle state
3. **Wallet Integration:** @mysten/dapp-kit for modern wallet standard support
4. **Asset Strategy:** All assets in public folder for Netlify CDN optimization
5. **Green Theme:** Exact color matching (#00ff00) for brand consistency
6. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
7. **No Emojis:** All icons from lucide-react library
8. **NFT Card Design:** Red gradient borders matching original screenshots

### Testing Notes

The application requires a Sui wallet extension to be installed in the browser. Users must have:
- A Sui wallet extension (Sui Wallet, Suiet, etc.)
- At least 3 SUI for battle entry fees
- A Sapling NFT from the deployed contract

### Known Limitations

1. NFT scanning requires actual Sapling NFTs from the specific contract
2. Battle queue requires at least 2 players to be online simultaneously
3. Wallet connection requires browser extension (no mobile wallet support yet)

### Contract Audit Summary

✅ **Security:** All access controls, economic safeguards, and fund safety mechanisms verified
✅ **Game Logic:** Battle mechanics, move generation, and win conditions working correctly
✅ **Code Quality:** Proper error handling, type safety, and gas optimization
✅ **Economics:** Balanced model verified (6 SUI in, 5 SUI to winner, 1 SUI to treasury)
